# Section 3: Getting started with Docker

This section is about familiarizing yourself with Docker. You'll follow along as Dan Wahlin explains how to use Docker with demonstrations from his github repo for this section. That repo is located here:

`https://github.com/DanWahlin/NodeExpressMongoDBDockerApp`

That said, a zip of the repo is located in this section 3 folder for your convenience. Just follow the instructions below to unzip and start using it. Please don't `git clone` Dan's repo into your working folders, as they are already in a local git repo, themselves. Git does support submodules, but that's outside the purpose of this course.

## Step 1: Ensure your local version of the repo is up to date with your forked origin/main
- use `git fetch` to discover any new changes in origin/main
- use `git pull` to make sure your local main matches origin/main

## Step 2: Create a local branch from main
- use `git checkout -b section-3` to create and edit a new branch (you can name it whatever you like)
- note that working in a branch here and below is simply for practicing git

## Step 3: Unzip the NodeExpressMongoDBDockerApp file
- `cd /<path>/learn-k8s-master/3-Getting_started_with_docker` if not there already
- `unzip NodeExpressMongoDBDockerApp.zip` (or your zip utility) to unzip the file

Now you can open the folder in VS Code or IDE of choice and follow along with the video. For additional git practice, you can follow steps 4 - 7 in Section 1 README.md to commit changes to your main branch and clean up your working branch, if you made one.

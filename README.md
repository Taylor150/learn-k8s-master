# Learn Kubernetes

## About The Project

This is the collaboration template repository to support the [K8s Fluency Channel](https://app.pluralsight.com/channels/details/7e329816-fa2b-4b66-8270-0f024e72afa8) on Pluralsight. The purpose of the training is to familiarize people with the tools and processes needed to create and run Kubernetes clusters. Each section requires 1 to 4 hours, depending on previous experience and patience. The information below will help establish the base of your learning environment on top of which each section has its own setup instructions for completing the lesson.

### Built With

* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* ...

## Getting Started

You will need several accounts and tools in your base learning environment. After you have your base established, some sections have a zipped GitHub repo containing additional files you'll need to follow along with the section's videos. 

### Accounts

* [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Tools

Because people will be on one of several platforms, installation instructions are linked in each tool below.

* [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* an IDE is useful, like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* [node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Setup

### Fork Sonatype's master repo to your GitHub

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

* Click the Fork button in the upper right corner
* Ensure your GitHub username is in the dropdown and enter a name for your forked repo (e.g., `austinlbradley/learn-k8s`) 
* Click Create Fork

Now your forked copy of the Sonatype master repo is located in your GitHub repositories.

### Clone your forked copy of the repo to your local machine

You will learn more about `git` in the early sections, but use these commands to clone your forked repo to your local development environment.

* Click the green `Code` button in GitHub above the list of directories and files of your repo
* Click the copy button next to the https address of your repo
* In a terminal on your local machine, change to the base directory where you want your cloned repo to live
* Clone the repo

```
~ $ cd ~/repos/
~/repos/ $ git clone https://github.com/<GitHub-user>/learn-k8s.git
```

Now you should be ready to start Section 1.

## Roadmap

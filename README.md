# Learn Kubernetes

## About The Project

This is the collaboration template repository to support the [K8s Fluency Channel](https://app.pluralsight.com/channels/details/7e329816-fa2b-4b66-8270-0f024e72afa8) on Pluralsight. The purpose of the training is to familiarize people with the tools and processes needed to create and run Kubernetes clusters. Each section requires 1 to 4 hours, depending on previous experience and patience. The information below will help establish the base of your learning environment on top of which each section has its own setup instructions for completing the lesson.

### Built With

* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* ...

## Getting Started

You will need several accounts and tools in your base learning environment. After you have your base established, some sections have a zipped GitHub repo containing additional files you'll need to follow along with the section's videos. 

### Accounts

* [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Tools

Because people will be on one of several platforms, installation instructions are linked in each tool below.

* [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* an IDE is useful, like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* [node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
